    HTML files created with Visual Studio start with a byte order mark (BOM),
    and are displayed by the browser as plain text rather than HTML.  
    To prevent that from happening, make a copy of this file instead.
    After that, you can edit the file in Visual Studio without fear
    of adding the BOM back in.
